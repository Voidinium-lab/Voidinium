## 🌟 Overview

Voidinium is a **zero-knowledge orchestrated swarm intelligence platform** that enables users to build software, workflows, and systems with strong privacy guarantees and without risk of data leaks. By combining advanced privacy-preserving computation techniques with ZK Swarm orchestration, Voidinium allows collaborative and intelligent data processing without ever exposing sensitive data in the clear.

### Key Features

- 🔒 **Zero-Knowledge Swarm Intelligence** - Privacy-first orchestration for distributed AI systems
- 🛡️ **End-to-End Privacy** - Data protected at rest, in transit, and in use
- 🔐 **Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)** - Hardware-based secure enclaves for confidential computing
- ✨ **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** - Cryptographic verification without revealing data
- 🤝 **Multi-Party Collaboration** - Secure data processing across organizations
- 📊 **Enterprise-Grade Compliance** - Built-in audit trails and governance
- 🚀 **Production-Ready** - Scalable architecture for real-world deployments

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

Voidinium is built on a modular architecture with the following key components:

### Core Components

- **Orchestration Layer** - Central coordination engine managing workflow execution across agent networks
- **Secure Agent Nodes** - Swarm of intelligent agents performing tasks in privacy-preserving sandboxes
- **Secure Execution Engine** - Supports TEE, ZK, and hybrid runtime options
- **Key Management** - Threshold KMS for cryptographic key handling
- **Data Layer** - Encrypted storage with append-only audit ledger

### Runtime Options

1. **TEE Mode** - Hardware-based isolation using Intel SGX, AMD SEV, ARM TrustZone
2. **ZK Mode** - Pure cryptographic verification using zk-SNARKs/zk-STARKs
3. **Hybrid Mode** - Combined TEE + ZK for maximum security

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- MongoDB (or MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/voidinium/voidinium.git
cd Voidinium

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
yarn install
```

### Configuration

Create `.env` files for backend and frontend:

**Backend `.env`:**
```env
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
DB_NAME=Voidinium
CORS_ORIGINS=*
```

**Frontend `.env`:**
```env
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8001
```

### Running the Application

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
yarn start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.

## 💻 Usage Example

```python
import json
from Voidinium import Agent

# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Quantitative-Trading-Agent",
    agent_description="Advanced quantitative trading and algorithmic analysis agent",
    model_name="gpt-4.1",
    dynamic_temperature_enabled=True,
    max_loops=1,
    dynamic_context_window=True,
    streaming_on=False,
    top_p=None,
    output_type="dict",
)

# Run a query
out = agent.run(
    task="What are the top five best energy stocks across nuclear, solar, gas, and other energy sources?",
    n=1,
)

print(json.dumps(out, indent=4))
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Multi-Party Data Analytics
Enable organizations to jointly analyze data and derive insights without exposing raw data to each other.

### Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning
Train and deploy AI models on sensitive data with verifiable privacy guarantees using federated learning and secure enclaves.

### Regulatory Compliance & Auditing
Allow regulators to verify compliance without institutions exposing customer data or trade secrets.

### Secure Collaborative Research
Share insights from confidential research data while maintaining data sovereignty across institutions.

### Enterprise Internal Privacy Sandbox
Enable data scientists to work on sensitive data with automated privacy controls and audit trails.

## 🔐 Privacy & Security Model

Voidinium ensures data remains protected through:

- **Data at Rest**: Strong encryption of all stored data
- **Data in Transit**: End-to-end encryption with mutual authentication
- **Data in Use**: Confidential computing via TEEs and encrypted computation
- **Input/Output Privacy**: Granular control over data visibility
- **Verification**: Zero-knowledge proofs and hardware attestation
- **Policy Enforcement**: Automated governance and compliance checks

### Trust Model

- Minimal trust assumptions - rely on provable artifacts
- Zero-trust architecture - verify everything cryptographically
- Hardware roots of trust combined with mathematical proofs
- Defense in depth with multiple security layers
